### Abstract
Wave Field Synthesis seeks to recreate arbitrary pressure distribution inside a certain arrangement of loudspeakers. Due to physical limitations, the audible scene created inside the array may exhibit considerable audible artifacts. Aside from the non-linear frequency response of the reproduction chain, these limitations are due to the limited amount of loudspeakers that can fit inside the chosen array. This bachelor thesis seeks to determine the correlation between the amount of speakers in a circular Wave Field Synthesis array and the overall perceived coloration of sound by conducting a listening experiment, in which WFS setups of varying sizes and listening positions are compared to a reference.

It is established that increasing the amount of speaker will reduce the perceived coloration in somewhat logarithmic relation, but won’t become transparent against a reference even at 3584 speakers. It is found that the reproduction performance of the WFS array surpasses that of a standard two speaker stereo setup when using more than 224 speakers while standing in the sweet spot; outside the centered position even a 14 speaker array is perceived as less colorated. As assumed, complex stimuli such as music or noise demand a bigger array to achieve the same amount of coloration compared to a band-passed signals such as speech. Surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the rating distribution of the music and the noise stimulus. Lastly, it is found that the dependency of perceived coloration is largerly independant of the location inside the array.

It is concluded that a circular array of 224 speakers should be considered as the best compromise between feasibility and reproduction fidelity as it performs not significantly different from an array with 16 times the speakers under most listening conditions and surpasses stereo in perceived coloration.
